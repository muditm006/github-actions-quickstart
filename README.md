# github-actions-quickstart

Feedback Text:
"During the beginning of the guide, it tells the user to create a file using this syntax ".github/workflows/github-actions-demo.yml". Although this command works and I had no problems following the rest of the guide, at the end it was a bit confusing because the github folder was actually smushed into ".github/workflows" - as it was hidden because it was empty. I think adding a note explaining that this will occur would be helpful."
